## Color Scheme
![Color Scheme](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fde5c0f-71ef-402b-9b78-5c13ef62404f)
The NouriSkin project uses a carefully picked set of colors to create a clean and modern look. White (**#FCFCFC**) gives a fresh and open feel, while black (**#131313**) adds strong contrast to make text easy to read. Dark gray (**#474747**) brings depth and style, and light gray (**#9F9F9F**) adds soft details to balance the design. Light Olive (**#DBD769**) adds warmth and draws attention to key parts. Together, these colors make the platform look simple and inviting.

## Typography
The NouriSkin project uses a clean and flexible typography system with the **Afacad** font from Google Fonts. This font was picked for its modern and stylish look, combining readability with elegance.

**Afacad** comes in different weights (**400 to 700**) and supports regular and italic styles, making it useful for headings, body text, and highlights. Using this font throughout the project creates a consistent and professional look that matches the clean and modern design.

## Wireframe
For designing the wireframes of this project, I chose Figma because of its strong visual features. Its easy drag-and-drop interface makes it simple to create clear and accurate wireframes. Since it’s cloud-based, Figma lets you access wireframes from anywhere without needing to install software.

 You can check out the wireframes for this project directly in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/KcPq8keW5OTh8diq5qYaUp/NouriSkin?node-id=0-1&m=dev&t=yM3FoMfwX7MMv0PY-1)


## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
![Entity-Relationship Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6451003-0551-4da7-921a-9d324a1bd60e)
For creating and visualizing the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for this project, I decided to use drawSQL because it’s easy to use and has great features. Its simple interface makes designing ERDs straightforward, while its tools help create clear and detailed diagrams efficiently.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47f70536-f250-4b8b-8bf1-86be953c65e3" alt="Facebook Page Screenshot" width="360"/>

A Facebook page is vital for expanding our market reach and connecting with our audience. It allows us to:

- Engage directly with customers.
- Showcase products and promotions.
- Drive traffic to our e-commerce store.
- Build trust and credibility.

Key Actions:

1. Created a complete page with accurate details and branding.
2. Uploaded essential assets like profile and cover images.
3. Published an engaging introductory post.
4. Captured a screenshot of the final page view for reference.

The Facebook page strengthens NouriSkin’s connection with its audience, driving growth and loyalty while maintaining compliance with platform policies.

#### Sitemap Configuration

I generated the sitemap for the website using [XML Sitemaps](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/). The sitemap includes important information about all the pages on the site, such as the last update date, how frequently they change, and their priority relative to other pages. After generating the sitemap, I placed it in the root directory of the website.

I also created a `robots.txt` file to guide search engine crawlers. This file helps manage which parts of the website can be indexed and prevents unnecessary sections from being crawled. I added the `robots.txt` file to the root directory alongside the sitemap.

   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install all required packages using `pip`:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Environment Variables**  
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following variables:  
     ```plaintext
     SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
     DEBUG=True
     DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
     STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
     STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
