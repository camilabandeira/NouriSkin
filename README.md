## Color Scheme
![Color Scheme](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fde5c0f-71ef-402b-9b78-5c13ef62404f)
The NouriSkin project uses a carefully picked set of colors to create a clean and modern look. White (**#FCFCFC**) gives a fresh and open feel, while black (**#131313**) adds strong contrast to make text easy to read. Dark gray (**#474747**) brings depth and style, and light gray (**#9F9F9F**) adds soft details to balance the design. Light Olive (**#DBD769**) adds warmth and draws attention to key parts. Together, these colors make the platform look simple and inviting.

## Typography
The NouriSkin project uses a clean and flexible typography system with the **Afacad** font from Google Fonts. This font was picked for its modern and stylish look, combining readability with elegance.

**Afacad** comes in different weights (**400 to 700**) and supports regular and italic styles, making it useful for headings, body text, and highlights. Using this font throughout the project creates a consistent and professional look that matches the clean and modern design.

## Wireframe
For designing the wireframes of this project, I chose Figma because of its strong visual features. Its easy drag-and-drop interface makes it simple to create clear and accurate wireframes. Since it’s cloud-based, Figma lets you access wireframes from anywhere without needing to install software.

For creating and visualizing the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for this project, I decided to use drawSQL because it’s easy to use and has great features. Its simple interface makes designing ERDs straightforward, while its tools help create clear and detailed diagrams efficiently.
