### HTML Testing

I tested and validated the HTML code of this project using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). To do this, I copied the link to the website and submitted it to the validator.

The tool checked if the HTML followed proper standards and highlighted any errors or warnings. I reviewed and fixed these issues to ensure the code is clean, functional, and meets the expected standards.
